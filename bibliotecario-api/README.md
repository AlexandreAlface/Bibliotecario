# Family Librarian Platform

## 📚 Project overview

The **Family Librarian** is a digital platform designed to encourage family reading habits by connecting families with a dedicated librarian. Taking inspiration from the concept of family doctors, the system provides personalised book consultations and recommendations based on each child's reading profile, using catalogues from the National Reading Plan (PNL Portugal).
The platform includes a web and mobile application, an intelligent chatbot that provides guided reading suggestions and gamification elements to keep children engaged throughout their literary journey.

- Offer curated cultural agendas and educational content.

## 👥 Target users:

- Families: Register, schedule consultations, receive book suggestions, subscribe to newsletters and access educational content.
- Children/adolescents: - Reserve books
